# Multi-Section Landing Page

This project aims to create a multi-section landing page that dynamically adds content and builds a navigation menu. It focuses on improving the user experience by differentiating the actively viewed section and implementing smooth scrolling when clicking on navigation items.

## Project Overview

Often, when working with a content management system (CMS) or an API, we don't know in advance how much content will be added to a page. This project tackles this issue by dynamically adding content to the landing page. It provides a flexible and scalable solution for handling variable content.

By dynamically building the navigation menu, this project serves as an introduction to working with the virtual DOM. Understanding how to manipulate and update the navigation menu using JavaScript lays the foundation for future work with JavaScript frameworks.

To enhance the user experience, the actively viewed section is visually differentiated from others. This provides users with a clear indication of their current location on the page. Additionally, clicking on a navigation item smoothly scrolls the page to the appropriate section instead of an abrupt jump.
